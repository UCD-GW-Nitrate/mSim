% Any software, code or library can be as difficult as the authors chose to
% make it. This section attempts to smooth out the learning curve of the mSim tool.
%%
% To go through the tutorials we assume that users have basic
% knowledge of groundwater modeling. Familiarity with finite element is
% not required but it wont hurt either
%%
% mSim is written in Matlab therefore basic knownledge of matlab interface and basic commands
% will make the learning process smoother.
% If matlab terms such as arrays, structs, cells, functions, scripts, sound
% greek, it is highly recommended to go through the 
% <http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/getting-started-with-matlab.html
% Getting Started with MATLAB> section first.

% The Tutorials are organized as follows:
%
% * <mesh_gen_main.html Mesh generation>
% * <oneD_examp_help.html 1D Examples>
% * <twoD_examples_help.html 2D Examples>
% * <threeD_examples_help.html 3D Examples>
% * <partTrack_examp.html Particle Tracking>
% * <NPSAT_examp.html Complete NPSAT example>
% * <Coastal_Aquifer.html Coastal Aquifer Simulation using mSim> (that's possible)
