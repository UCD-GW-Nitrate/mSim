% In this section you can find few tutorials on how to use mSim functions
% for simulating steady state groundwater flow in 2D. The tutorials cover
% most of the type of elements, boundary conditions and stress types that
% one encounters in groundwater flow simulations.
% 
% # <example_1_help.html Example 1> Triangular elements, constant head
% boundary conditions, general head boundary conditions, non-uniform diffuse 
% groundwater recharge, uniform hydraulic conductivity 
% # <example_2_help.html Example 2> Quadrilateral elements, non-uniform
% hydraulic conductivity, lateral fluxes, quadratic elements
% # <Coastal_Aquifer.html Coastal Aquifer Simulation> This is a real world
% example that uses the 2D groundwater flow equation to simulate the
% seawater intrusion based on the sharp interface approxination
% # <PumpingOptimizationExample1.html Pumping optimization> This is a
% hypothetical example that shows how to combine mSim with matlab
% optimization algorithms.
