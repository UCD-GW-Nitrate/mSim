% Although mSim was not developed for coastal aquifer simulations we
% illustrate here that it is possible to use it when we assume that the sharp interface
% approximation is reasonable. In particular we are using the sharp interface 
% approximation that was developed by 
% <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169404002057 Mantoglou et al., (2004)>.
% The workflow that is described below was also used by 
% <http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10040-015-1293-7 Kourakos
% and Mantoglou (2015)>.
%% Aquifer description
% The coastal aquifer is located at the central part of Santorini island in
% Greece. The north and south boundaries are considered no flow, while the 
% east and west boundaries are seawater fronts. The hydraulic
% conductivity and groundwater recharge are spatially variable. The DATA folder of the
% mSim bitbucket repository provides the related shapefiles.
%% Mesh generation
% The first step in numerical modeling is to generate a mesh for the
% modeling domain. This example is based on a real case study and the
% domain is described by shapefiles. Hence we first read the data related 
% to aquifer geometry and then initialize a CSG object:
domain = shaperead(['/DATA/Santorini_outline']);
wells = shaperead(['/DATA/Santorini_wells']);
santorini = CSGobj_v2(2,1,500,1000,10); % Dim,Npoly,Nline,Npoints,usertol
%%
%  Then we put the domain outline into the empty object. Note that the
%  domain outline should always be the first object to be read into the CGS
%  object.
santorini = santorini.readshapefile(domain);
%%
% We can plot anytime the content of the CSG object using the method:
santorini.plotCSGobj
axis equal; axis off
%%
% Next we will add the wells into the CGS object. However we need to clean
% the shapefile because not all the wells lay inside the domain. (There 
% are few wells that are almost near the shoreline). In addition to this
% we want to add few more fields which instruct Gmsh how to refine the mesh 
% around the wells. Here we specify the minimum element length near the 
% wells equal to 5 m and the maximum element length equal to 500 m at 
% 1 km distance from the wells.
dlt = [];
for i = 1:size(wells)
    in = inpolygon(wells(i,1).X, wells(i,1).Y, domain.X, domain.Y);
    if in
        wells(i,1) = wells(i,1);
        wells(i,1).DistMin = 5;
        wells(i,1).DistMax = 1000;
        wells(i,1).LcMin = 5;
        wells(i,1).LcMax = 500;
    else
        dlt = [dlt; i];
    end
end
wells(dlt,:)=[];
%%
% Now we can add the wells into the CSG and plot the entities contained
% within
santorini = santorini.readshapefile(wells);
santorini.plotCSGobj
axis equal; axis off
%%
% Before generating the mesh we need to define few options related to mesh
% generation
meshopt=msim_mesh_options;
meshopt.lc_gen = 300;
meshopt.embed_points = 1;
%%
% To generate the mesh first we write the geometry and options to a file
santorini.writegeo('santorini',meshopt);
%% 
% With the gmsh input file ready the last step is to run gsmh to generate
% the mesh
gmsh_path = '$HOME/Downloads/gmsh-2.12.0-Linux/bin/gmsh';
santorini.runGmsh('santorini', gmsh_path, []);
[p MSH]=read_2D_Gmsh('santorini',0 ,0);
%% 
% The mesh consists of 2D triangular elements therefore we can easily 
% visualize it in matlab
clf
triplot(MSH(3,1).elem(1,1).id, p(:,1), p(:,2))
axis equal; axis off
%% Hydraulic conductivity
% The hydraulic condictivity is spatially variable and consists of zones 
% of uniform hydraulic conductivity. The shape of the zones and their 
% values are defined by the following shapefile
cond = shaperead(['/DATA/Santorini_Cond']);
%%
% Now we have to assign a conductivity value to each mesh point. First we 
% allocate a variable to hold the conductivity
K = nan(size(p,1),1);
%%
% Then we loop through the hydraulic conductivity zones and identify which 
% mesh points lay inside each zone.
for i = 1:size(cond,1)
    in = inpolygon(p(:,1),p(:,2), cond(i,1).X,cond(i,1).Y);
    K(in,1) = cond(i,1).KX;
end
%%
% Due to simplification of the boundaries, some points are slightly outside
% the simplified domain. Therefore we use nearest neibrhood interpolation 
% to assign hydraulic conductivities for points with nan values.
% In general is a good practice to make sure that there are no nans or
% negative values assigned to hydraulic conductivity
id_nan = find(isnan(K));
id_no_nan = find(~isnan(K));
IDX = knnsearch(p(id_no_nan,:), p(id_nan,:));
K(id_nan,1) = K(id_no_nan(IDX),1);
%% Groundwater recharge (fluxes on elements)
% Groundwater recharge is also given by a shapefile that consists of several
% groundwater rechagre zones.
rch = shaperead(['/DATA/Santorini_Rech']);
%%
% However here we will assign the groundwater recharge values to the 
% elements as areal sources (not on the mesh points).
% First we allocate a matrix to hold recharge values
R = zeros(size(MSH(3, 1).elem.id, 1),1);
%%
% Next we compute the barycenters of the mesh triangles
cc = Calc_Barycenters(p(:,1:2), MSH(3, 1).elem.id);
%%
% Last we loop through the groundwater recharge zones and assign the 
% recharge rates to the elements
for i = 1:size(rch,1)
    in = inpolygon(cc(:,1), cc(:,2), rch(i,1).X, rch(i,1).Y);
    R(in,1) = rch(i,1).RECHARGE;
end
%%
% In the case of groundwater recharge, the elements outside of the boundaries
% of the rch shapefile get zero recharge as the recharge shapefile covers 
% only the non zero recharge areas.
%%
% To assign the diffuse groundwater recharge we define a structure as
% follows:
FLUX(1,1).id = [1:size(MSH(3, 1).elem.id, 1)]'; % element ids
FLUX(1,1).val = R; %element values
FLUX(1,1).dim=2; % dimension of the elements
FLUX(1,1).el_type='triangle'; % This is the type of element
FLUX(1,1).el_order='linear'; % This is the element order
FLUX(1,1).id_el=1; % This is the index of the elements in the MSH.elem array
%% Well rates (Point fluxes)
% The actual well rates will be computed via the optimization. However
% we will set a constant rate equal to -10 m^3/day for demonstration. 
% To do so we have to find the mesh node ids that correspond to the wells.
FLUXwells = zeros(size(p,1),1);
for i = 1:size(wells,1)
    [dst id] = min(sqrt((wells(i,1).X - p(:,1)).^2 + (wells(i,1).Y - p(:,2)).^2));
    FLUXwells(id,1) = -10;
end
%%
% Note that *FLUXwells* is an array with size equal to the mesh nodes that
% has zero values everywhere except the mesh nodes associated with a point
% source.
%% Boundary conditions
% According to the problem description the east and west boundaries are 
% constant head equal to 0 (sea boundary). The north and south are 
% considered impervious boundaries. The east constant head boundary is 
% described by the domain line segments with id 1:15, while the west 
% boundary is described by the line segments with ids 18:31
id_cnst = false(size(p,1),1);
for i = 1:14
    L = [domain.X(i) domain.Y(i) domain.X(i + 1) domain.Y(i + 1)];
    dst = Dist_Point_LineSegment(p(:,1), p(:,2),L);
    id_cnst(abs(dst - 0)< 0.5) = true;
end
for i = 18:30
    L = [domain.X(i) domain.Y(i) domain.X(i + 1) domain.Y(i + 1)];
    dst = Dist_Point_LineSegment(p(:,1), p(:,2),L);
    id_cnst(abs(dst - 0)< 0.5) = true;
end
CH = [find(id_cnst) zeros(sum(id_cnst),1)];
%%
% There are no general rules on how to identify the ids of the boundaries.
% Here we loop through the segments of the outline that we know they
% correspond to constant head boundary and for each segment we calculate
% the distance between the line and the mesh nodes. The nodes with distance
% less than a specified threshold are assumed to lay on the boundary.
%%
% To verify that we have identified the correct nodes as boundary 
% conditions its good practice to visualize them
plot(p(:,1),p(:,2),'.')
hold on
plot(p(CH(:,1),1),p(CH(:,1),2),'or')
axis equal; axis off
%% Assemble LHS and RHS matrices
% Now we are ready to assemble the system matrices. For the LHS we set the 
% following options and then run:
simopt.dim=2;
simopt.el_type='triangle';
simopt.el_order='linear';
[Kglo H]= Assemble_LHS(p, MSH(3,1).elem(1,1).id, K , CH, [], simopt);
%%
% Although this is not nessecary we can visualize the sparsity pattern of 
% the conductance matrix.
spy(Kglo)
%%
% It appears that the mesh numbering by gmsh does not produce very good 
% clustering around the main diagonal. In matlab we can try to improve this
% by using the available renumbering algorithm such as
clf
renum1 = symrcm(Kglo);
subplot(1,2,1);spy(Kglo(renum1,renum1)); title('Reverse Cuthill-McKee ordering')
renum2 = symamd(Kglo);
subplot(1,2,2);spy(Kglo(renum2,renum2)); title('Approximate minimum degree')
%%
% Last we assemble the RHS. First we assemble the element sources, which
% essentially are distributed to the mesh nodes, and then we add the node
% sources to the resulting vector.
F_rch= Assemble_RHS(length(H),p, MSH, FLUX);
F = F_rch + FLUXwells;
%% Solve
% To solve the system we simply execute:
PHI=solve_system(Kglo(renum1,renum1), H(renum1), F(renum1));
%%
% Note that in the solve_system function we use as inputs the renumbering 
% from the Reverse Cuthill-McKee ordering algorithm. The renumbering 
% affects the matrices during the execution of the "solve_system" command 
% and the matrices in the main wordspace remain intact.
%%
% However the solution PHI corresponds to the new numbering set by renum1. 
% To revert it back to the original numbering we have to find the current row
% of each vertex. This is quite simple task as follows: 
[lia, locb] = ismember([1:size(p,1)],renum1);
PHI = PHI(locb);
%%
% Although the msim solves the PDE of groundwater flow equation, in this 
% case the result is not the hydraulic head field, but the potential Î¦. 
% To convert it to hydraulic head we use the following formula from
% <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169404002057 Mantoglou et al., (2004)>.
Head = sign(PHI).*sqrt(2*0.025.*abs(PHI)/(1+0.025));
%%
% As we are using 2D triangle elements we can visualize the solution
clf
trisurf(MSH(3,1).elem(1,1).id, p(:,1), p(:,2),Head,'edgecolor','none',...
    'FaceColor','interp','FaceLighting','phong')
camlight right
view(0,90);axis off;daspect([2500 2500 1])
