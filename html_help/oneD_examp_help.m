% Although solving the flow equation for 1D domain has no particular
% interest we will cover this for completeness. The somewhat 
% interesting application here is the solution of the 1D ADE which 
% is presented next
%
% # <Flow_1D_std.html Flow problem> Here we solve the groundwater flow
% equation for a simple 1D domain.
% # <Transport_1D_help.html ADE problem> Next we present how to solve 1D
% ADE and do a sensitivity analysis of the various parameters of the ADE.
