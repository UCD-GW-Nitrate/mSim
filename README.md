mSim Toolbox

* Description

mSim toolbox is a suite of Matlab functions which are primarily used to simulate non-point source pollution in groundwater
aquifers based on Finite element methods. The current version of mSim solves the following equations:

1) 1-2-3D steady state groundwater flow equation.

2) Particle Tracking.

3) 1D Advection dispersion equation.

In addition mSim provides a number of functions which assist with the pre/post-processing tasks involved in a 
finite element simulation as well as functions which are used in the non-point source pollution modeling.

For the mesh generation we rely on Gmsh generator, and for visualization we used Paraview or Visit.
